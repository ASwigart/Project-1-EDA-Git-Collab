# Project-1-EDA-Git-Collab
Project 1 of the NU Data Analytics
Proposal: To use the Cook County Assessor's Office's historical data to track potential effect of policy changes on rents or home values, comparing the county assessed values with Zillow's dataset's rental or home prices. We think finding a sample of zip codes might help us focus on particular patterns. After looking at the assessor's office, we think we might need another dataset, so we will start with the American Community Survey for property values.

topic and why you chose it: This topic combines public policy and real estate transactions which is a good story to tell and the datasets seem available. Our hypothesis is that the new policy at the assessor's office had a material impact on stablizing property values and rents.

initial questions for data (at least 3)
  1. How compatible the assessor's office dataset and the zillow datasets are?
  2. Is using zip codes as a basis for comparision feasible?
  3. Can our computers handle the volume of data, its 41million rows.
  4. What will we use to match the values of property? Property identification vs. address?
  5. Since the real estate market as been so hot in recent years, will this hypothesis be noticable?
